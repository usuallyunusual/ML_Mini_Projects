# ML_Mini_Projects
Contains a variety of machine learning algorithms implemented in python with decent explanations
1. Basic data exploration contains the fundamentals of importing to pandas and using stat moments to find out more about the data
2. Habermans survival contains good visualization and exploration of the Habermans cancer suriviors dataset
3. KMeasn clustering contains the algorithm implemented on custom blobs (To show how it works) and on a weather dataset for more realisitc exposure
4. LDA and PCA demo contains an in depth exploration of the PCA and the LDA algorithms as dimensionality reduction techniques and Classifiers(LDA) validated on tensorflow nets(Keras)
6. Naive Bayes Classification has the algorithm worked on numerical and text classification (TFIDF)
7. PCA Demo contains an overview of how PCA works and how exactly it helps, using Logistic Regression to validate results
